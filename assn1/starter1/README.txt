1) How do I compile?

cd <top-level dir of starter1>; mkdir build; cd build; cmake -j ..; make -j

Using the -j flag gives maximum performance; you can compile even through SSH
really, really quickly. This compilation works on SSH and local Athena PCs.

2) Collaborated?

No.

3) Useful references/websites?

I found the CCW y-axis rotation matrix here:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/ref/roty.html.
Couldn't find it anywhere in our slides, so I Googled it.

4) Known problems with the code?

Not as far as I know. Matches up to the renders generated by
the sample solution.

5) Extra credit completed?

None.

6) General comments?

My artifacts are in the swp folder.

Please encourage people to search through source symbols more. I almost
implemented all the math and matrix ops myself before going through
the symbols in the project and seeing all the included methods.
