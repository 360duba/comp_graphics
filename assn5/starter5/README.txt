Assignment 5 - Textures & Shadows

1. Build Instructions (Athena with Makefile)
==================
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -j ..
$ make -j

2. Collaboration

Absolutely none.

3. References

Just the lecture slides. Had to dig around
GLSL documentation a little bit too to
fully understand what was happening.

4. Known problems

For shadow fragment visibility, I settled on
60%. This was an arbitrary decision, but it
doesn't affect functionality, so I don't think
it's a problem, per se, but I did choose it
myself.

5. Extra credit

None.

6. Comments

Please introduce students to GLSL before
making us dive right in! Similar to C++,
yes, but still tricky to read and grasp
at first.
